# Code and Opinion = Codepinions

After all this time, I'm finally starting a blog. It's been a long time coming,
sorry it's taken so long. This blog will be a platform to talk about coding: what's
good, what's bad, what's silly. Maybe some viewpoints about programmer culture will
get mixed in. We'll see where the night takes us. #letsgetweird

## Format

Call me lazy, but the format of this blog will be as a mailbag. Yes, I'll rely on
various readers to generate topics for me. Terrible, I know. Small posts may be
combined into one, while larger subjects can get their own post all on their own.

Questions should be submitted as issues under Github. I really like Github. Submit
those issues here: https://github.com/kayakyakr/codepinions/issues.

## Open Source

You can call me even lazier, but this blog is open source as well. Don't agree with
my response? Mention that in the issue comments OR submit a PR with an amended
answer. Want to write your own codepinion and let me take partial credit for it?
Submit a PR with a post. It's totally a win-win scenario for both of us!

## About the author

Hi, my name is Charles DuBose. I program things, raise chickens, try to garden, and
have opinions. My primary areas of expertise lie in full-stack development with Ruby,
Javascript, and both SQL and document (Mongo, specifically) databases. But don't
let that stop you from asking about anything else. Code is universal and so language
doesn't matter.
